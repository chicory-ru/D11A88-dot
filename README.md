# D11A88
Sketch of the DM11A88 LED module for pyboard. Images are encoded in a double-digit list. For example,
the number 57 lights a pixel in the fifth row in the seventh column.
img = (11, 18, 81, 88)  <- will light 4 corner pixels. 
The image is drawn one pixel at a time and because of the high speed it looks like a single whole.
